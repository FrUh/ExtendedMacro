  <p>Provides similar but extended functionality of the BurpSuite Macro
  feature. The main functionality is that you are able to trigger one or more
  requests before every request triggered from Intruder, Repeater, Scanner,
  Sequencer or Spider (except from Proxy and Extender). You can extract data
  from an arbitrary response of the request and replace or add data to the
  following request (replace CSRF token, session, add new header, etc.)</p>
