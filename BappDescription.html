  <p>This extension provides a similar but extended version of the Burp Suite macro
  feature. </p>
  <p>The main functionality is that you are able to trigger one or more
  requests before every request made by Intruder, Repeater, Scanner,
  Sequencer or Spider. You can extract data from an arbitrary response and replace or add data to the
  following request (replace CSRF token, session, add new header, etc.).</p>
